++ Instructions to set up airSuck
  - Install prerequisites listed above on the host or hosts that will run each component.
  - Clone the airSuck git repository using: git clone https://github.com/ThreeSixes/airSuck.git
  - Move the airSuck folder to /opt.
  - Copy the necessary supervisor scripts from supervisor/ to /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
    - In order to recieve AIS data you'll need the aisConnector and aisStateEngine scripts.
    - In order to recieve ADS-B data you'll need at least one of the dump1090ConnClt or airSuckServer scripts and the ssrStateEngine.
    - If you want to get ADS-B using dump1090ConnClt you'll have to have a dump1090 instance with the --net flag set.
    - If you're running the airSuckClient script you also need to have dump1090 installed on the machine running the script. By default the configuration expects it to be installed in /opt/dump1090.
    - In order to use the Node.JS web server copy the stateNode script to the conf.d folder.
    - If you want to store state or raw data in MongoDB you'll need to add mongoDump and/or stateMongoDump.
  - In /opt/airSuck/config copy config.py to /opt/airSuck. This is a template for the main configuration file.
  - Edit /opt/airSuck/config.py to match your environment in terms of hosts, requirements, etc.
  - If you're using stateNode to view vehicle telemetry on Google Maps make sure you copy /opt/airSuck/config/config.js to /opt/airSuck/node/.
    - Edit config.js in the node folder to have the same Redis state queue properties as the ones conifigured in config.py.
    - The default web server port for stateNode is 8090. It can be changed to wahtever you want.
  - Restart supervisor using /etc/init.d/supervisor restart. That will start the airSuck stack.
  - To check for issues with the stack you can manually run scripts inside /opt/airSuck, and check log files in /var/log/supervisor/.
