AirSuck is an ADS-B/SSR processing and storage project that uses the dump1090 project to tune into and provide binary SSR data. It is designed to be used in a distributed fashion with support for multiple dump1090 instances as data sources, input data deduplication, MLAT pass-though, and employs REDIS for queueing and deduplication of data, as well as MongoDB for data storage. It should be possible to use some of the libraries classes such as ssrParse.py with other Python projects, and connectors for multiple data inputs and outputs can be developed to expand supported data source applications and destination applications.
